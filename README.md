## what is react?
Js library / framework for creating user interfaces. It uses components.

- React handles all changes first in the virtual DOM after which it intelligently identifies which changes to actually make on  the real DOM.

## What is JSX? 
## JSX?ESX? ES5?ES6?
- ES ECMASCRIPT  - regular JavaScript 
* Most browsers support ES5 but few support ES6 for now, therefore inorder to reap the benefits of ES6 today we have to: 
-i. transpire our code so that a wide range of browsers can understand our JS
*** transpire *** convert ES6 to ES5 
-ii. include shim/polyfill that provides additonal functionality in ES6 that our browser may or may not have.

**JSX** JavaScript Extension - allows us to write JavaScript that lookslike HTML.
